# Session Summary - Complete System Migration & Advanced Features

## Date: October 2-4, 2025

## Major Accomplishments

### 1. Complete Database Migration ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Problem**: Database setup complexity and connection issues
- **Solution**: Migrated to SQLite file-based database
- **Changes**:
  - Updated `DATABASE_URL` to use `sqlite+aiosqlite:///./jamanager.db`
  - Created new `schema_sqlite.sql` with SQLite-specific syntax
  - Updated all SQLAlchemy models to use `String` instead of `UUID`
  - Replaced `JSONB` with `JSON` for SQLite compatibility
  - Created `init_sqlite_db.py` for database initialization
- **Result**: Zero-configuration database setup, eliminated connection issues

### 2. UUID to String ID Conversion ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Problem**: UUID complexity and SQLite compatibility issues
- **Solution**: Converted all IDs from UUID to string-based system
- **Changes**:
  - Removed all `uuid` imports from Python files
  - Updated ID generation to use `secrets.token_hex(16)`
  - Removed all `uuid.UUID()` conversions in API endpoints
  - Updated Pydantic models to use `str` instead of `uuid.UUID`
  - Fixed attendee registration and voting permission issues
- **Result**: Simplified ID system with better compatibility

### 3. Jam Manager Voting Permissions ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Problem**: Jam managers couldn't vote on songs
- **Solution**: Added `vote_jam_manager` feature flag
- **Changes**:
  - Added new feature flag for jam manager voting in `feature_flags.py`
  - Updated `can_vote()` function to include jam managers
  - Updated `get_available_actions()` in `user_roles.py`
  - Fixed frontend localStorage integration for attendee IDs
- **Result**: All user types (anonymous, registered, jam managers) can now vote

### 4. Ultimate Guitar Integration ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Problem**: No chord sheet lookup functionality
- **Solution**: Integrated Ultimate Guitar API with web scraping
- **Changes**:
  - Created `ultimate_guitar_service.py` for chord sheet lookup
  - Added `chord_sheet_api.py` with search and selection endpoints
  - Updated song creation and jam pages with chord sheet buttons
  - Added visual indicators for linked chord sheets
- **Result**: Automatic chord sheet lookup and linking for songs

### 5. Complete Chord Sheet Management System ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Problem**: Limited chord sheet functionality, no real-time updates
- **Solution**: Full chord sheet management with real-time updates and access control
- **Changes**:
  - Created `jam_chord_sheets` table for jam-specific chord sheet overrides
  - Added chord sheet validation with database storage
  - Implemented real-time WebSocket broadcasting for chord sheet updates
  - Added access control (plebs cannot see chord sheet status)
  - Created comprehensive chord sheet editor modal with search and validation
  - Added visual indicators (✓ available, ⚠ broken/unavailable)
  - Implemented click-to-open functionality for valid chord sheets
- **Result**: Complete chord sheet management system with real-time updates

### 6. Advanced UI Features ✅ **COMPLETED**
- **Problem**: Limited sorting and filtering options
- **Solution**: Comprehensive song management with sorting, filtering, and performance order
- **Changes**:
  - Added song sorting by name, artist, votes, and performance order
  - Implemented performance order calculation (votes desc, then name asc)
  - Added performance order numbers with visual badges
  - Created modern notification system with auto-dismiss
  - Enhanced mobile responsiveness
- **Result**: Professional-grade song management interface

## System Status

### Current State ✅ **FULLY FUNCTIONAL**
- **Database**: SQLite with string-based IDs and chord sheet validation
- **Voting**: Universal voting for all user types with real-time updates
- **Features**: Complete feature set with advanced chord sheet management
- **Real-time**: WebSocket broadcasting for all updates (votes, performances, chord sheets)
- **UI**: Modern interface with sorting, filtering, and performance order
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions with chord sheet visibility control
- **Setup**: Zero-configuration database setup with 30 popular songs pre-loaded
- **Access**: Access code `jam2024` for jam manager privileges
